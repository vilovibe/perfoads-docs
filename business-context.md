# Business Context

Business Context is information you provide about your business that helps the AI give you better, more personalized insights.

## Why Business Context Matters

Without context, the AI can only tell you **what** happened:
> "Your CPA increased to $63."

With context, the AI understands **why it matters** and **what to do**:
> "Your CPA increased to $63, which is 26% above your $50 target. The 'General Keywords' campaign is driving this up. Consider pausing low-performing keywords or tightening your audience targeting."

## Types of Context

### Business Profile
Basic information about the business:
- **Company name**: Full business name
- **Industry**: What type of business (e-commerce, services, B2B, etc.)
- **Target audience**: Who are the ideal customers
- **Key products/services**: What the business sells
- **Geographic focus**: Where customers are located

### Goals & Targets
What success looks like:
- **Target CPA**: Maximum acceptable cost per conversion
- **Target ROAS**: Desired return on ad spend
- **Monthly budget**: Total ad spend budget
- **Conversion goals**: What actions matter most (purchases, leads, calls)

### Custom Context
Anything else the AI should know:
- Seasonal patterns (busy/slow months)
- Recent changes (new products, promotions)
- Competitive landscape
- Budget constraints
- Business priorities

## Adding Business Profile

1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Click the **"Business Profile"** tab
3. Fill in the form fields:
   - Company Name
   - Account Name (how you want to refer to this client)
   - Country
   - Email
4. Click **"Save Profile"**

### Company Logo (Optional)
Upload a logo to personalize the client's profile. This helps you visually identify clients quickly.

## Adding Custom Context

1. Go to any client's dashboard
2. Click the **"Context"** tab
3. Type your context information in the text box
4. Click **"Add Context Entry"**

### What to Include in Context

**Good context examples:**
- "Target CPA is $50. Anything above that is unprofitable."
- "Summer months (June-August) are our busiest season."
- "We sell premium skincare products to women aged 30-55."
- "Brand awareness campaigns should prioritize reach over conversions."
- "We're running a 20% off promotion this month."

**Avoid vague context:**
- "Do better" (not actionable)
- "We want more sales" (everyone does - be specific about targets)
- "Fix the ads" (the AI needs context, not commands)

## Editing Context

### Business Profile
Go to Settings > Business Profile and update any field, then click "Save Profile."

### Custom Context Entries
On the Context tab:
- **Edit**: Click the edit icon (pencil) next to any entry
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to remove outdated context

## How AI Uses Context

The AI references your context when:
- **Answering questions** in AI Chat
- **Generating Smart Alerts** (alerts consider your targets)
- **Analyzing performance** (compares actual vs your goals)
- **Making recommendations** (suggestions aligned with your business)

## Context Privacy

Your context is:
- ✅ Only visible to you and your team
- ✅ Never shared with other users
- ✅ Used only to personalize your AI experience
- ✅ Stored securely in your account

## Best Practices

**Update regularly**: Add context when business goals or strategies change.

**Be specific**: Include actual numbers (target CPA, budget limits) rather than vague goals.

**Include seasonal info**: Tell the AI about busy/slow periods so it understands patterns.

**Mention recent changes**: If you launched a new product or changed strategy, add it to context.

**Don't overthink it**: Start with basic info and add more over time as needed.

## Examples of Great Context

**E-commerce business:**
> "We sell outdoor camping gear online. Target CPA is $35. Peak season is April-September. Average order value is $120. We focus on customers aged 25-45 who enjoy hiking and camping."

**Local service business:**
> "We're a plumbing service in Austin, TX. Target CPA is $75 per lead. We only serve customers within 30 miles. Most calls come during business hours Mon-Fri. Emergency services have higher margins."

**B2B SaaS business:**
> "We sell project management software to small businesses. Target CPA for trial sign-ups is $45. Sales cycle is 30-60 days. We focus on construction and consulting firms with 10-50 employees."
