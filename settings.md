## Best Practices

**Review notification settings regularly**: Adjust based on what emails you actually find useful.

**Keep Business Profile updated**: Accurate business information improves AI insights.

**Enable "Sync Failed" notifications**: So you know immediately if data stops updating.

**Check Sync History if something seems wrong**: It shows exactly when data was last updated.

**Use Manual Sync sparingly**: Auto-sync handles most needs. Manual sync is for urgent updates only.
