[Screenshot: All four summary cards]
*Summary cards give you instant portfolio-wide visibility*

### 3. Bulk Actions Toolbar

Appears when you select clients using checkboxes:

**Select All** - Check all clients on current page
**Sync Selected** - Run Smart Sync on all selected
**Delete Selected** - Remove multiple clients at once
**Clear Selection** - Deselect all

## Actions Menu Deep Dive

Click the three-dot menu (‚ãÆ) next to any client to reveal all available actions.

### View Details

**What it does**: Opens client detail page

**Shortcut**: Click client name directly

**When to use**:

**What you'll see**: 6-tab interface with Overview, Campaigns, Ad Groups, Keywords, AI Chat, Settings

[Screenshot: Client details page]
*Detailed view shows everything for one account*

---

### Smart Sync

**What it does**: Pulls new data since last sync (2-4 minutes)

**How it works**:
1. Calculates date range based on last sync
2. Pulls only new data from Google Ads
3. Updates campaigns, keywords, ads, performance
4. Triggers AI analysis
5. Generates new alerts if issues found

**When to use**:
- Before client calls (get fresh data)
- After making Google Ads changes

[Screenshot: Smart Sync progress in client list]
*Watch sync progress without leaving the page*

**Pro Tip**: Smart Sync is smart - it only pulls what's new. Use this 99% of the time.

---

### Full Sync (30 Days)

**What it does**: Re-syncs last 30 days of data (5-15 minutes)

**How it differs from Smart Sync**:
- Ignores last sync date
- Pulls full 30 days regardless
- Takes longer
- Uses more API quota

**When to use**:
- Data looks wrong or incomplete
- Metrics don't match Google Ads interface
- Major campaign restructure happened
- Troubleshooting data accuracy issues

**When NOT to use**:
- Daily routine syncs (use Smart Sync)
- Quick refresh before calls (use Smart Sync)
- Just checking for new data (use Smart Sync)

**Warning**: Full Sync uses 10-20x more API quota than Smart Sync. Use sparingly.

[Screenshot: Purge Data confirmation dialog]
*Purging is permanent - use carefully*

**Warning**: This cannot be undone. Only purge if you're certain.

---

### Delete Client

## Filtering and Sorting

### Filter by Status

Click Status filter dropdown:

**Filter options**:
- ‚òë Active (default: checked)
- ‚òë Syncing (default: checked)
- ‚òë Failed (default: checked)
- ‚òë Paused (default: unchecked)

**Use cases**:

**Show only failed syncs**:
- Uncheck all except Failed
- See which clients need troubleshooting

**Hide paused clients**:
- Uncheck Paused
- Clean view of active clients only

**Show everything**:
- Check all boxes
- See entire client portfolio

[Screenshot: Status filter dropdown with checkboxes]
*Filter to focus on specific client groups*

---

### Sort Columns

Click any column header to sort:

**Click once**: Ascending (A‚ÜíZ, 0‚Üí9, oldest‚Üínewest)
**Click twice**: Descending (Z‚ÜíA, 9‚Üí0, newest‚Üíoldest)
**Click third time**: Remove sort (back to default)

**Useful sorts**:

**By Last Sync (oldest first)**:
- Find clients with stale data
- Prioritize syncs

**By Alerts (highest first)**:
- See which clients need most attention
- Triage optimization work

**By Client Name (A‚ÜíZ)**:
- Alphabetical organization
- Find clients quickly

**By Synced Days (lowest first)**:
- Find clients with limited data
- Identify partial syncs

[Screenshot: Column headers with sort arrows]
*Click headers to reorder the table*

---

### Search

**Search box** in top right searches across:
- Client name
- Customer ID
- Website URL

**Search tips**:

**Partial matches work**:
- Type "ACME" finds "ACME Corp"
- Type "123" finds "123-456-7890"

**Case insensitive**:
- "acme" = "ACME" = "Acme"

**Clears filters**:
- Search overrides status filters
- Shows all matching clients regardless of status

**Example searches**:
- `bakery` - Find all bakery clients
- `123-456` - Find by customer ID
- `.com` - Find all with website URLs

[Screenshot: Search results showing filtered clients]
*Search across multiple fields simultaneously*

---

## Pagination and Performance

### Items Per Page

**Selector** at bottom of table:
- 10 items (fastest load)
- 25 items (default)
- 50 items
- 100 items (slowest load)

**Recommendations**:

**5-20 clients total**: Use 50 items per page
- See everyone at once
- No pagination needed

**20-50 clients**: Use 25 items per page
- Good balance
- Fast loading

**50+ clients**: Use 10-25 items per page
- Keeps page responsive
- Use search/filters to find clients

[Screenshot: Items per page selector]
*Choose based on total client count*

---

### Performance Tips

**For large client lists (30+ clients)**:

**Use filters aggressively**:
- Filter to Active only (hide paused)
- Filter to Failed when troubleshooting
- Don't load everything at once

**Leverage search**:
- Search is faster than scrolling
- Type a few characters to narrow results

**Increase items per page carefully**:
- 100 items = slow load
- Better to use search/filters

**Close other tabs**:
- Client list is memory-intensive
- Other tabs slow it down

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

**Navigation**:
- `Ctrl+K` (Windows) or `Cmd+K` (Mac) - Focus search box
- `Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N` - Add new client
- `Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` - Refresh page

**Selection**:
- `Shift+Click` - Select range
- `Ctrl+A` or `Cmd+A` - Select all (within table)

**Actions** (when client is focused):
- `Enter` - Open client details
- `S` - Smart Sync
- `E` - Edit client info
- `D` - Delete client

   - Any broken syncs overnight?
   - Fix immediately

3. **Sort by Last Sync (oldest first)**
   - Identify stale data
   - Select and bulk sync if needed

4. **Sort by Alerts (highest first)**
   - Which clients need attention today?
   - Review top 3-5 critical alerts

**Time**: 5 minutes to triage your entire portfolio

---

### Before Client Calls

1. **Search for client name**
2. **Check Last Sync time**
   - If older than 1 hour ‚Üí Smart Sync
3. **While sync runs, review alerts**
4. **Open client detail page**
5. **You have fresh data for the call**

**Time**: 3-4 minutes

---

   - Delete old test clients
   - Remove ended contracts

2. **Check Total Spend card**
   - Compare to last week
   - Investigate large changes

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Organization

**Naming convention**:
- Use consistent format: `[Company] - [Location/Type]`
- Example: `ACME Corp - Main`, `Bakery - Downtown`
- Makes alphabetical sorting useful

**Tag paused clients**:
- Add "[PAUSED]" to client name
- Easy to identify even when filtering is off
- Example: `[PAUSED] Old Client - Test`

**Group by industry** (optional):
- Prefix with industry: `Legal - Smith & Associates`
- All legal clients group together when sorted

---

### Performance Management

**Don't sync everything at once**:
- Stagger auto-sync times
- Avoid 20 clients syncing at 2 AM
- Spread across 2-3 hours

**Pause inactive clients**:
- If campaigns stopped, disable auto-sync
- Saves API quota
- Reduces clutter

**Archive old clients**:
- Delete clients from 6+ months ago
- Or pause and add "[ARCHIVE]" to name

---

### Alert Management

**Daily triage**:
- Sort by Alerts (highest first)
- Work through top 5 clients
- Accept/decline recommendations
- Track resolution progress

**Set alert thresholds**:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Alert Preferences
- Choose minimum severity to show
- Filter out noise from low-priority alerts

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I rename the client list columns?**
A: Not currently. Column names are fixed, but you can sort by any column.

**Q: What's the maximum number of clients I can manage?**
A: No hard limit, but performance is best with 50 or fewer. Contact sales for enterprise needs (100+ clients).

**Q: Can I export the client list to CSV?**
A: Coming soon! This feature is planned for Phase 4.

**Q: Why don't I see all clients when I search?**
A: Search respects status filters. If filtering to "Active only" and you search for a paused client, it won't show. Clear filters to see all matches.

**Q: Can I customize which columns are visible?**
A: Not yet, but column customization is on the roadmap.

**Q: What happens if I delete a client by accident?**
A: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. That's why we require typing the client name to confirm. Be very careful.

**Q: Can I restore a deleted client?**
A: No. Once deleted, all data is permanently removed. You can re-add the client, but you'll start from scratch with a new sync.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Client list loads slowly

**Symptom**: Page takes 10+ seconds to load

**Causes**:
- Too many items per page (100 items)
- 50+ total clients
- Slow internet connection

**Solution**:
1. Reduce items per page to 25
2. Use filters to show subset of clients
3. Close other browser tabs
4. Refresh the page

### Problem: Bulk sync seems stuck

**Symptom**: First few clients sync, then others stay "Queued" forever

**Causes**:
- One sync failed, blocking the queue
- API limit reached
- Backend issue

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Check Sync Logs for errors
3. Cancel queued syncs
4. Try syncing in smaller batches (5-10 at a time)

### Problem: Actions menu doesn't open

**Symptom**: Clicking ‚ãÆ does nothing

**Causes**:
- Browser extension blocking JavaScript
- Page not fully loaded
- Browser compatibility issue

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Wait for page to fully load
3. Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
4. Disable browser extensions temporarily

### Problem: Search doesn't find existing client

**Symptom**: You know client exists but search returns nothing

**Causes**:
- Status filters exclude the client
- Misspelled search term
- Client was deleted

**Solution**:
1. Clear all status filters (check all boxes)
2. Try searching by Customer ID instead of name
3. Check other pages (pagination)
4. Verify client wasn't deleted
