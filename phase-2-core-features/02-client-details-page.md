## Common Questions

**Q: Can I see data older than 90 days?**
A: No, the system syncs and stores the last 90 days. This is standard for Google Ads performance analysis.

**Q: Why don't some metrics show data?**
A: Some metrics (like Quality Score, Impression Share) aren't available for all campaign types. If Google Ads doesn't provide it, we can't show it.

**Q: Can I compare two date ranges side-by-side?**
A: Not directly in the UI. Export data for two different ranges and compare in Excel/Sheets.

**Q: Do AI Alerts auto-update daily?**
A: Yes, AI re-analyzes after each sync. New alerts appear, resolved issues disappear automatically.

**Q: What happens if I decline an alert by mistake?**
A: You can view declined alerts in the Alert History section. While you can't "un-decline," the AI may generate a similar alert if the issue persists.

**Q: Can I chat with AI about multiple clients at once?**
A: No, AI Chat is client-specific. Each chat only sees data for that one client. Use the global AI Chat for cross-client questions.

**Q: Why is my budget tracking showing "No budget set"?**
A: You need to add a monthly budget in the client's business profile (Edit Client ‚Üí Monthly Budget field).

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Metrics show $0 or blank values

**Symptom**: Metric cards display $0, N/A, or blank

**Causes**:

**Solution**:
1. Change date range to larger window (e.g., Last 30 Days)

3. Sync the client to pull latest data
4. If still blank, account may truly have no spend

---

**Symptom**: Chart area shows loading spinner forever

**Causes**:
- Very large dataset (50+ campaigns, 90-day range)
- Browser compatibility issue

2. Refresh the page
3. Try different browser
4. Check browser console for errors

---
