## How Metrics Are Calculated

### Aggregation Methods

**Sum** (add all values):
- Clicks
- Impressions
- Cost
- Conversions

**Average** (weighted by impressions):
- CTR
- CPC
- Conversion Rate

**Example**:
```
Campaign A: 100 clicks, 10,000 impressions, CTR 1%
Campaign B: 50 clicks, 5,000 impressions, CTR 1%

Combined CTR:
(150 clicks ÷ 15,000 impressions) × 100% = 1%

NOT (1% + 1%) ÷ 2 = 1% (this would be wrong for different impression counts)
```

---

## Date Range Impact

**Important**: Metrics change based on selected date range

**Example**:
```
Last 7 days:
- Clicks: 100
- CTR: 2%

Last 30 days:
- Clicks: 500
- CTR: 2.5%
```

**Why different**: Performance fluctuates over time

**Best practice**: Compare same time periods (week-over-week, month-over-month)

---

## Currency Handling

**All cost metrics in account currency**:
- Set in Google Ads account settings
- Cannot be changed in PerfoAds
- Common: USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD

**Conversion**:
- If you need different currency, convert externally
- Use consistent exchange rate for period
- Document exchange rate used

---

## Missing or N/A Metrics

**Why metrics show "N/A"**:

**Quality Score**: Not available for:
- New keywords (<1,000 impressions)
- Paused keywords
- Display campaigns

**Impression Share**: Not available for:
- Very low volume campaigns
- Brand new campaigns
- Some campaign types

**Video metrics**: Only for Video campaigns

**This is normal** - Google Ads doesn't provide all metrics for all scenarios

---

## Tips for Using Metrics

### Focus on What Matters

**For e-commerce**:
- ROAS (primary)
- Conversion Rate
- Cost Per Conversion
- CTR

**For lead generation**:
- Cost Per Conversion
- Conversion Rate
- Quality Score
- CTR

**For brand awareness**:
- Impressions
- Impression Share
- CPM
- Engagement Rate

---

### Compare Metrics Together

**Example analysis**:
```
High CTR + Low Conversion Rate =
  → Ad is attractive but landing page is weak
  → Fix: Improve landing page

Low CTR + High Cost =
  → Ad not relevant, paying too much
  → Fix: Improve ad copy, lower bids

High Impression Share Lost (Budget) + Good ROAS =
  → Profitable but budget-limited
  → Fix: Increase budget
```

---

### Set Up Conversion Tracking

**Without conversions**:
- Can only optimize for clicks
- Don't know if ads drive business results
- Missing most important metrics

**With conversions**:
- Optimize for revenue
- Calculate ROAS
- Make data-driven decisions

**Action**: Set up conversion tracking ASAP

## Common Questions

**Q: Why is my CTR higher in PerfoAds than Google Ads?**
A: Check the date range - they should match. If ranges match and still different, wait 24 hours for data to sync.

**Q: Can I create custom metrics?**
A: Not currently. You can export data and calculate custom metrics in Excel.

**Q: Why is my Cost Per Conversion $0?**
A: You have conversions but haven't assigned values to them in Google Ads. This is normal for lead generation.

**Q: What's the difference between Conversions and Conversion Value?**
A: Conversions is the count. Conversion Value is the total monetary value. If you sell products, this is revenue.

**Q: Why don't I see video metrics?**
A: You need Video campaigns. Video metrics don't apply to Search or Shopping campaigns.

**Q: Can I see metrics by device (mobile, desktop, tablet)?**
A: Not directly in PerfoAds UI yet. Export campaign data and analyze in Google Ads.
