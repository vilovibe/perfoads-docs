# Smart Alerts

Smart Alerts are AI-powered notifications that tell you when something important happens in your Google Ads campaigns.

## What Are Smart Alerts?

Instead of manually checking your campaigns every day, PerfoAds AI monitors everything 24/7 and alerts you when:
- Something needs immediate attention
- Performance changes significantly
- There's an opportunity to improve
- Good news worth celebrating

## Alert Severity Levels

Alerts are color-coded by importance:

### ðŸ”´ Critical Alerts (Red)
**Urgent issues requiring immediate action.**

Examples:
- Campaign suddenly stopped getting conversions
- Cost per conversion spiked dramatically
- Budget running out faster than expected
- Campaign paused unexpectedly

**What to do**: Review and act on these alerts immediately.

### ðŸŸ¡ Important Alerts (Yellow)
**Significant changes that need your attention soon.**

Examples:
- Conversion rate dropped by 20%
- Cost per click increased significantly
- Campaign performance trending downward
- New competitor ads detected

**What to do**: Review within 24 hours and make adjustments if needed.

### ðŸŸ¢ Good News Alerts (Green)
**Positive developments worth knowing about.**

Examples:
- Conversion rate improved significantly
- Cost per conversion decreased
- Campaign performing better than usual
- New high-performing keywords discovered

**What to do**: Note what's working well and consider scaling it.

## Viewing Alerts

### Alerts Page
Click "Smart Alerts" in the sidebar to see all alerts across all clients.

**Filter alerts by:**
- Severity (Critical, Important, Good News)
- Client
- Date range
- Status (Active, Dismissed, Resolved)

### Alert Counter
The bell icon (ðŸ””) in the top navigation shows how many unread alerts you have.

### Per-Client Alerts
On each client's dashboard, the "Smart Alerts" tab shows only alerts for that specific client.

## Understanding an Alert

Each alert shows:

### Alert Title
Quick summary of what happened (e.g., "Conversion Rate Dropped 30%")

### Severity Badge
Color-coded indicator (Critical, Important, Good News)

### Timestamp
When the alert was generated

### Full Description
Detailed explanation of:
- What changed
- Why it matters
- What you should consider doing about it

### Affected Campaigns
Which specific campaigns or ad groups are involved

## Taking Action on Alerts

You have two options for each alert:

### Dismiss
Use when:
- You've seen the alert but don't need to act
- The alert is not relevant to you
- You want to clear it from your list

**Effect**: Alert is marked as read and moves to "Dismissed" status. You can still view it in the dismissed alerts list.

### Resolve
Use when:
- You've taken action based on the alert
- You've fixed the issue
- You've implemented the suggested improvement

**Effect**: Alert is marked as completed and moves to "Resolved" status. This helps track which alerts you've acted on.

## Alert Filters

Use filters to focus on what matters:

### By Severity
- Show only Critical alerts (urgent issues)
- Show only Important alerts (needs attention)
- Show only Good News alerts (positive updates)

### By Status
- **Active**: New alerts you haven't reviewed yet
- **Dismissed**: Alerts you've seen but didn't act on
- **Resolved**: Alerts you've addressed

### By Date
- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Custom date range

## Alert Settings

Configure how you receive alerts in the **Settings > Email Notifications** page:

### Smart Alerts Toggle
Turn email notifications on/off for Smart Alerts.

### Email Frequency
Choose how often you want alert emails (immediately, daily digest, weekly summary).

### Severity Threshold
Choose which alert levels trigger emails (Critical only, Important and Critical, or All alerts).

## Best Practices

**Check alerts daily**: Even if you don't get email notifications, check the alerts page once a day.

**Don't ignore Critical alerts**: Red alerts usually indicate problems that get worse if ignored.

**Act on patterns**: If you see the same type of alert repeatedly, investigate the root cause.

**Use Resolve vs Dismiss properly**: Resolve when you've acted, Dismiss when you've just reviewed.

**Review Good News alerts**: Learn from what's working well so you can replicate success.
