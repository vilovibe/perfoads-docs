# Managing Clients

The Clients page is where you manage all your Google Ads accounts. Each connected Google Ads account appears as a "client" in PerfoAds.

## Client List Overview

The main clients page shows:
- **Client Name**: The name of each connected Google Ads account
- **Last Sync**: When data was last updated (automatically every 24 hours)
- **Status**: Whether the account is active or has issues
- **Quick Stats**: Overview of spend and conversions

## Adding a New Client

Click the **"Add Client"** button to connect a new Google Ads account:

1. Click "Add Client" in the top-right
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Grant PerfoAds permission to access Google Ads data
4. Your account will appear in the list within seconds
5. First data sync happens automatically within 24 hours

## Viewing Client Details

Click on any client name to see their full dashboard with:
- Performance charts
- Smart alerts
- AI chat
- Campaign details
- Business context

## Client Actions Menu

Click the three dots (â‹®) next to any client to access actions:

### Manual Sync
Force an immediate data refresh instead of waiting for the automatic 24-hour sync.

### Refresh Data
Update the client's information and reconnect if there are authentication issues.

### Delete Client
Remove the client from PerfoAds. This disconnects the Google Ads account but doesn't affect your actual Google Ads campaigns.

## Bulk Operations

Select multiple clients using the checkboxes to:
- **Sync multiple clients** at once
- **Delete multiple clients** in one action

Use the **"Select All"** checkbox at the top to quickly select all clients.

## Filtering Clients

Use the search bar to quickly find specific clients by name.

## Client Status Indicators

- **Green checkmark**: Everything is working correctly
- **Yellow warning**: May need attention (outdated sync, missing data)
- **Red error**: Connection issue - needs reconnection
