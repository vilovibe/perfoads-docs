## Client List Table

This is where you spend most of your time - viewing and managing clients.

### Table Columns Explained

Each row represents one client. Here's what every column means:

#### Client Name

**What it shows**: The friendly name you gave the client

**Features**:

**Example**: `ACME Corp`, `Bakery - Downtown`

[Screenshot: Client name column with edit icon]

**Format**: Always `XXX-XXX-XXXX`

#### Last Sync

**What it shows**: When data was last refreshed

**Examples**:

*Color-coded freshness helps you spot stale data quickly*

#### Synced Days

**What it shows**: How many days of data you have

**Example**: `90 days`

## Tips & Best Practices

### Daily Workflow

**Morning routine**:
1. Check summary cards - any unusual numbers?
2. Sort by Alerts (highest first) - which clients need attention?
3. Filter to Failed - any broken syncs overnight?
4. Review clients with red Last Sync - data stale?

**Throughout the day**:
- Use search to quickly find specific clients
- Sync before client calls for fresh data
- Check Active Syncs card if platform seems slow

### Staying Organized

**Naming convention**: Use consistent names so sorting works well
- Good: `ACME Corp`, `Bakery - Downtown`, `Law Firm - Smith`
- Bad: `client1`, `test`, `asdf`

**Regular cleanup**:
- Delete old test clients
- Pause inactive clients (not currently advertising)
- Update budgets when client spending changes

### Performance Optimization

**Large client lists** (20+ clients):
- Use search instead of scrolling
- Use filters to focus on relevant subsets
- Consider syncing in batches (not all at once)

**Slow dashboard**:
- Check Active Syncs - if 5+ are running, wait for some to finish
- Refresh browser if metrics seem frozen
- Close other tabs to free up memory

## Common Questions

**Q: Why don't I see any clients?**
A: You haven't added any yet. Click "Add Client" in the top right to get started.

**Q: Can I rearrange the columns?**
A: Not currently, but you can sort by any column to reorganize the list.

**Q: What does the dash (-) mean in the Alerts column?**
A: No alerts for that client. Either the account is healthy or AI hasn't analyzed it yet.

**Q: Why is Last Sync showing "Never" for a client I just added?**
A: You added the client but haven't run a sync yet. Click Actions ‚Üí Smart Sync to pull data.

**Q: Can I hide paused clients from the list?**
A: Yes, use the Status filter and uncheck "Paused" to hide them.

**Q: What happens if I delete a client by accident?**
A: All data is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. You can re-add the client, but you'll need to sync from scratch.

**Q: How many clients can I manage from one dashboard?**
A: No hard limit, but we recommend 50 or fewer for best performance. Contact sales for enterprise pricing if you need more.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Dashboard shows old data

**Symptom**: Metrics don't match Google Ads, Last Sync times look wrong

**Solution**:
1. Click the refresh button (top right)
2. Wait 5 seconds for data to reload
3. Check if Last Sync updated
4. If still wrong, try logging out and back in

### Problem: Client stuck in "Syncing" status

**Symptom**: Status shows "Syncing" for 20+ minutes

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the dashboard
2. Check Sync Logs page for that client
3. If truly stuck, contact support (provide client name and timestamp)

### Problem: Summary cards show zeros

**Symptom**: Total Clients shows 0, Total Spend shows $0

**Solution**:
1. Check if you have any clients added (table should have rows)
2. Refresh the dashboard
3. Check if clients have been synced (Last Sync should not be "Never")
4. If clients exist but cards show 0, contact support

### Problem: Actions dropdown doesn't work

**Symptom**: Clicking Actions (‚ãÆ) does nothing

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the page
2. Try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge all supported)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Disable browser extensions that might interfere
