# What is PerfoAds?

PerfoAds is your AI-powered assistant for managing Google Ads accounts. Instead of spending hours pulling reports and analyzing data, the system does it automatically - syncing your data, spotting problems, and suggesting fixes.

Think of it as having a Google Ads expert watching all your client accounts 24/7, catching issues before they become expensive.

## What Does It Do?

PerfoAds handles three main things:

### 1. **Automatic Data Sync**
Pulls your latest Google Ads data every day - campaigns, keywords, performance numbers, everything. You get fresh data without manual exports.

*Your client dashboard shows all accounts with their latest data automatically synced*

### 2. **AI-Powered Alerts**
Claude (AI) analyzes your accounts and flags issues like:
- Budget waste on low-performing keywords
- Ad groups with declining performance
- Campaigns missing conversions
- Better bidding strategies available

*AI Alerts catch problems you might miss in day-to-day management*

### 3. **Smart Insights**
Chat with AI about any account. Ask questions like "Why did my CTR drop?" or "Which campaigns should I prioritize?" and get answers based on your actual data.

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: Nope! It's a web app - just log in at app.aiperfoads.xyz

A: No. PerfoAds only *reads* your data. It never makes changes to campaigns, bids, or budgets. You stay in control.

**Q: How often does data sync?**
A: Once per day by default. You can also run manual syncs anytime, or adjust the schedule in Settings.

A: Perfect! The system handles both direct access and MCC-managed accounts. Just connect once and all your client accounts appear.

**Q: Is my data secure?**
