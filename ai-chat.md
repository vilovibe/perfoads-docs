# AI Chat

AI Chat lets you have conversations with an AI assistant that understands your Google Ads campaigns and business context.

## What Can You Ask?

Ask the AI anything about your campaigns in plain English:

**Performance questions:**
- "Why are my conversions down this week?"
- "Which campaign is performing best?"
- "What's my average cost per conversion?"

**Strategy questions:**
- "Should I increase my budget?"
- "Which keywords should I pause?"
- "How can I improve my CTR?"

**Comparison questions:**
- "How does this month compare to last month?"
- "Which ad group has the best conversion rate?"
- "Is my CPA improving or getting worse?"

**Recommendations:**
- "What should I focus on this week?"
- "Where am I wasting money?"
- "How can I get more conversions?"

## Starting a Conversation

### From Client Dashboard
1. Go to any client's dashboard
2. Click the "Smart Chat" tab
3. Type your question in the message box at the bottom
4. Click "Send" or press Enter

### Quick Actions

Click any Quick Action button to instantly ask common questions:

- **"Analyze Performance"**: Get a full overview of how the client is doing
- **"Cost Optimization"**: Find ways to reduce wasted spend
- **"Conversion Analysis"**: Understand conversion trends and patterns
- **"Campaign Comparison"**: Compare performance across campaigns

These templates help you get started without typing.

## How AI Chat Works

The AI has access to:
- **All your campaign data**: Metrics, performance, trends
- **Your business context**: Information you've added in the Context tab
- **Historical data**: Can compare current vs past performance
- **Smart Alerts**: Knows what issues have been detected

The AI uses this information to give you **personalized, context-aware answers**.

## Understanding Business Context

The better your business context, the better the AI's answers.

**Without context:**
> "Your CPA increased 20%."

**With context (AI knows your target CPA is $50):**
> "Your CPA increased to $63, which is 26% above your target of $50. Consider pausing the 'General Keywords' campaign which is driving this up."

See the [Business Context](#business-context) section to learn how to add context.

## Best Practices

**Be specific**: Instead of "How am I doing?", ask "How are my conversions this week compared to last week?"

**Provide context**: The more business context you add, the more helpful the AI's answers.

**Ask follow-ups**: If the answer isn't clear, ask the AI to explain further or give more details.

**Use Quick Actions**: These templates are designed to trigger comprehensive analysis.

## AI Chat vs Smart Alerts

**Smart Alerts**: Proactive notifications when something changes (AI watches for you)

**AI Chat**: On-demand answers to your specific questions (you ask the AI)

Use both together:
1. Smart Alerts notify you of issues
2. AI Chat helps you understand and solve them

## Tips for Better Answers

**Good questions:**
- "Why did my conversion rate drop 15% in the last 3 days?"
- "Which campaigns should I increase budget for?"
- "What's causing my high CPA in the 'Summer Sale' campaign?"

**Vague questions:**
- "What's happening?" (too broad)
- "Fix my ads" (AI can't make changes, only advise)
- "Why?" (without specifying what you're asking about)

**The AI can:**
- ✅ Analyze your data and explain trends
- ✅ Recommend optimizations and strategies
- ✅ Compare performance across campaigns
- ✅ Explain why metrics changed

**The AI cannot:**
- ❌ Make changes to your Google Ads campaigns
- ❌ Access data from other platforms
- ❌ Predict the future with certainty
- ❌ Make decisions for you (it advises, you decide)
