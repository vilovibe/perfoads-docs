## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Converting Markdown to HTML

Run the conversion script to generate HTML files from markdown:

\`\`\`bash
node convert-docs.js
\`\`\`

This reads each `.md` file, converts it to HTML using the template, and outputs `.html` files.

### Template Structure

The `TEMPLATE.html` file contains the complete page structure including:
- Top navigation header
- Sidebar with documentation links
- Main content area
- Footer

All generated HTML files use this template for consistency.

## üìù Writing Guidelines

Documentation follows these principles:
- **Simple language**: Written for regular users, not developers
- **Concise**: Short, useful explanations without unnecessary detail
- **Practical**: Focus on how to use features, not technical implementation
- **Clear structure**: Consistent H2/H3 headings and section organization
