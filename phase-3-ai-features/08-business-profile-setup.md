## What You'll Learn

- Why Business Profile matters
- Every field explained with examples

## Why Fill Out Business Profile?

### The Difference It Makes

**Without Business Profile**:
```
You: "Is my $50 CPA good?"
AI: "CPAs vary by industry. You should compare to your goals."
(Generic, not actionable)
```

**With Business Profile** (target CPA: $40):
```
You: "Is my $50 CPA good?"
AI: "Your $50 CPA is 25% above your $40 target. This costs
you approximately $560/month in lost efficiency.

To reach target:
1. Improve QS on top 12 keywords (currently 4.8 avg)
2. Add 15 negative keywords ($280/mo waste identified)
3. Pause Display campaign ($85 CPA vs $40 target)

Expected result: CPA drops to $38-42 range."
(Specific, actionable, quantified)
```

```

---

- Determines appropriate campaign types

- Influences budget recommendations

**Options**:
- **B2B (Business to Business)**: Longer sales cycles, higher values, lead quality focus
- **B2C (Business to Consumer)**: Shorter sales cycles, higher volume, conversion focus
- **Local Services**: Geographic focus, call tracking important, local inventory ads
- **E-commerce**: Shopping campaigns, product feeds, transaction optimization
- **Lead Generation**: Form fills, call tracking, lead quality over volume
- **Brand Awareness**: Impression share, reach metrics, Display/Video focus

**Example impact**:
```
Business Type: B2B
AI recommends: LinkedIn remarketing, thought leadership, long nurture

Business Type: E-commerce
AI recommends: Shopping campaigns, remarketing, product feed optimization
```

---

### Field 3: Company Size

**What it is**: Number of employees or business scale

**Why it matters**:
- Calibrates budget expectations
- Suggests appropriate tools/features
- Influences strategic recommendations

**Options**:
- **Solo / Freelancer** (1 person)
- **Small** (2-10 employees)
- **Medium** (11-50 employees)
- **Large** (51-200 employees)
- **Enterprise** (200+ employees)

**Example impact**:
```
Size: Solo
AI won't suggest: Complex reporting systems, large team workflows

Size: Enterprise
AI will suggest: Multiple account structures, advanced attribution
```

---

### Field 4: Target Audience

**What it is**: Who you're trying to reach (free text, 2-3 sentences)

**Why it matters**:
- Guides keyword recommendations
- Influences ad messaging suggestions
- Affects geographic and demographic targeting advice

**Good examples**:

**B2B Professional Services**:
```
"CFOs and finance directors at mid-market companies ($10M-$500M
revenue) looking for fractional CFO services and financial
strategy consulting."
```

**Local Home Services**:
```
"Homeowners in the Dallas metro area needing emergency plumbing
repairs, water heater installation, or pipe replacement. Focus
on residential, not commercial."
```

**E-commerce**:
```
"Women aged 25-45 interested in sustainable fashion, organic
clothing, and eco-friendly accessories. Price-conscious but
willing to pay premium for quality."
```

**SaaS**:
```
"Marketing managers at SMBs (50-500 employees) looking for email
marketing automation, CRM integration, and lead nurturing tools.
Tech-savvy, comparing multiple solutions."
```

**Bad examples**:
```
❌ "Everyone who needs our product"
❌ "Business owners"
❌ "People in the US"
```

**Be specific**: Demographics, pain points, decision-makers

---

### Field 5: Business Goals

**What it is**: Primary objectives for Google Ads (free text, 2-4 sentences)

**Why it matters**:
- AI optimizes toward your actual goals
- Filters out conflicting recommendations
- Sets success criteria for optimizations

**Good examples**:

**Lead Generation**:
```
"Generate 50+ qualified leads per month at $80 CPA or less.
Lead quality is critical - prefer fewer high-quality leads
over high volume. Focus on commercial intent keywords."
```

**E-commerce**:
```
"Achieve 4.5+ ROAS across all campaigns with emphasis on
repeat customers. Growing average order value from $85 to
$100+ is secondary goal. Profitable growth over volume."
```

**Brand Awareness**:
```
"Increase brand search volume by 25% over next 6 months.
Impression share on branded terms should be 90%+. Willing
to accept higher CPA for awareness campaigns."
```

**Local Services**:
```
"Drive 80+ phone calls per month from qualified homeowners
needing emergency repairs. Geographic focus on immediate
service area (20-mile radius). After-hours calls are lower
quality."
```

**Bad examples**:
```
❌ "Make money"
❌ "Get more customers"
❌ "Increase sales"
```

**Be specific**: Quantify goals, prioritize if multiple objectives

---

### Field 6: Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)

**What it is**: Maximum amount you're willing to pay for one conversion

**Why it matters** (CRITICAL):
- AI uses this to judge all CPAs good/bad
- Alert severity calibrated to this number
- Optimization priorities ranked by CPA impact

**How to set it**:

**Method 1: Profitability-based** (ideal):
```
Customer Lifetime Value: $500
Profit margin: 40%
Target CPA: $500 × 40% × 50% = $100
(50% = reasonable ad spend vs LTV ratio)
```

**Method 2: Current performance** (fallback):
```
Current average CPA: $65
Competitive but achievable target: $55 (15% improvement)
```

**Method 3: Industry benchmark**:
```
Legal services: $150-$300 typical
Set target: $200 (mid-range)
```

**Examples by industry**:
- **Legal**: $150-$400
- **Home Services**: $50-$150
- **E-commerce**: $20-$60 (or use Target ROAS instead)
- **SaaS**: $100-$300
- **Healthcare**: $80-$200

**Important**: Be realistic, not aspirational

**If you don't know**: Leave blank initially, fill in after 30 days of data

---

### Field 7: Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

**What it is**: Revenue returned for every dollar spent on ads

**Why it matters**:
- AI optimizes for profitability, not just volume
- Alternative to CPA for revenue-tracking businesses
- Calibrates "good" vs "bad" ROAS

**Formula**: `Revenue ÷ Ad Spend = ROAS`

**Example**:
```
Ad spend: $1,000
Revenue: $4,500
ROAS: 4.5 (or 450%)
```

**How to set it**:

**Method 1: Profitability breakeven**:
```
Profit margin: 40%
Breakeven ROAS: 1 ÷ 0.40 = 2.5
Target ROAS: 3.5 (profitable with buffer)
```

**Method 2: Current performance plus margin**:
```
Current ROAS: 3.2
Target ROAS: 3.8 (20% improvement goal)
```

**Benchmarks by industry**:
- **E-commerce**: 3-5 (good), 5-8 (excellent)
- **SaaS**: 3-6
- **Lead gen with tracking**: 4-8

**When to use** (instead of CPA):
- E-commerce with transaction tracking
- Known revenue per conversion
- Variable conversion values

**When to use CPA instead**:
- Lead generation (no immediate revenue)
- All conversions same value
- No revenue tracking set up

---

### Field 8: Monthly Budget

**What it is**: Total monthly ad spend across all campaigns

**Why it matters** (CRITICAL):
- AI respects budget constraints
- Recommendations scaled to your budget
- Prevents unrealistic expansion suggestions

**How to set it**:
```
Daily budget: $100/day
Monthly budget: $100 × 30.5 = $3,050
(Use 30.5 average days/month)
```

**If budget varies by month**:
```
Enter: Average monthly budget
Note in Business Goals: "Budget 2x higher Nov-Dec for holiday"
```

**Examples by scale**:
- **Small Local**: $1,000-$3,000/month
- **Growing SMB**: $3,000-$10,000/month
- **Established Business**: $10,000-$50,000/month
- **Enterprise**: $50,000+/month

**Impact on recommendations**:
```
Budget: $2,000/month (set)
AI won't suggest: "Launch Shopping + Video + Display simultaneously"
AI will suggest: "Focus budget on highest-ROI Search campaigns"

Budget: $50,000/month (set)
AI will suggest: "Expand to Shopping, test Performance Max, build remarketing"
```

---

### Field 9: Website URL

**What it is**: Your client's primary website

**Why it matters**:
- One-time AI website analysis during setup
- Understands products/services offered
- Identifies target audience indicators
- Suggests keyword themes

**Format**: `https://example.com`

**AI analyzes** (during initial setup):
- Homepage content
- Service/product pages
- Value propositions
- Competitor positioning
- Industry signals

**Note**: Analysis happens once at setup, not continuously

---

### Field 10: Main Products/Services

**What it is**: What you sell or offer (free text, 2-4 bullet points)

**Why it matters**:
- Helps AI suggest relevant keywords
- Influences campaign structure recommendations
- Guides ad copy suggestions

**Good examples**:

**Professional Services**:
```
- Fractional CFO services
- Financial forecasting and planning
- M&A advisory and due diligence
- Cash flow management
```

**E-commerce**:
```
- Organic women's clothing (dresses, tops, pants)
- Sustainable accessories (bags, jewelry)
- Eco-friendly home goods
- Gift bundles and curated collections
```

**SaaS**:
```
- Email marketing automation platform
- CRM integration (Salesforce, HubSpot)
- Lead scoring and nurturing
- Analytics and reporting dashboards
```

**Home Services**:
```
- Emergency plumbing repairs (24/7)
- Water heater installation and replacement
- Pipe repair and repiping
- Drain cleaning and sewer line services
```

**Bad examples**:
```
❌ "We do marketing"
❌ "Various services"
❌ "Check our website"
```

**Be specific**: Include product categories, service types, unique offerings

## When to Update Business Profile

### Update when goals change

**Examples**:
```
Target CPA decreased: $80 → $65 (efficiency push)
Budget increased: $5K → $10K/month (expansion)
Strategy shift: Lead volume → Lead quality focus
```

**Impact**: AI immediately uses new targets

---

### Update when business evolves

**Examples**:
```
Expanded services: Added "emergency 24/7" to offerings
New audience: Now targeting enterprise, not just SMB
Seasonal shift: Holiday budget 3x normal
```

**Impact**: AI recommendations realign

---

### Quarterly review recommended

**Every 3 months**:
1. Review all fields
2. Update if business changed
3. Verify targets still accurate
4. Add new products/services

**Time**: 5 minutes to review

---

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Leaving Target CPA blank

**Problem**: AI can't judge performance

**Example**:
```
Actual CPA: $85
AI: "Your CPA is $85" (no context if good/bad)

With target ($65):
AI: "Your $85 CPA is 31% above target, costing $420/month..."
```

**Fix**: Set target based on profitability or current average

---

### Mistake 2: Aspirational targets

**Bad**:
```
Current CPA: $90
Target: $30 (unrealistic 67% drop)
```

**Good**:
```
Current CPA: $90
Target: $75 (achievable 17% improvement)
```

**Why**: Aspirational targets make all alerts high-severity (constant noise)

---

### Mistake 3: Too vague audience description

**Bad**: "Business owners in the US"

**Good**: "CFOs at $10-500M revenue manufacturing companies
in the Midwest, looking for financial planning and
cost reduction consulting"

**Impact**: Vague = generic AI recommendations

---

### Mistake 4: Never updating profile

**Problem**: Business evolves, profile doesn't

**Example**:
```
Profile says: Monthly budget $5K
Reality: Budget now $12K (2x growth)

AI still thinks: "Can't recommend expansion, budget is $5K"
```

**Fix**: Quarterly review and update

---

## Advanced: Multiple Profiles

### When You Need Multiple

**Use case 1: Seasonal businesses**:
```
Profile A: "Summer Season" (high budget, growth focus)
Profile B: "Winter Season" (low budget, efficiency focus)
```

**Use case 2: Different business units**:
```
Profile A: "Service Division" (B2B, long cycle, high CPA)
Profile B: "Product Division" (B2C, short cycle, low CPA)
```

**Current limitation**: One profile per client

**Workaround**: Use Custom Context for temporary overrides

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Be specific, not generic

**Generic**: "Get customers"
**Specific**: "Generate 50+ qualified HVAC installation leads per month at $95 CPA"

---

### Quantify everything possible

**Vague**: "Increase ROI"
**Quantified**: "Achieve 4.5+ ROAS"

---

### Update immediately when strategy changes

**Don't wait for quarterly review** if major change happens:
- Budget doubled
- Target CPA shifted
- New product line launched
- Audience changed

**Update takes 3 minutes**, AI benefits immediately

---

### Use Business Goals for context

**Include strategic nuances**:
```
"Lead quality is more important than volume - we can only
handle 60 leads/month, so prefer 40 excellent leads over
100 mediocre leads."
```

This context helps AI prioritize correctly

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to fill out every field?**
A: No, but Target CPA, Monthly Budget, and Business Goals are most critical for good AI.

**Q: Can I change targets later?**
A: Yes, update anytime. AI uses latest values immediately.

**Q: What if I don't know my target CPA yet?**
A: Leave blank for first 30 days, then set based on actual performance average.

**Q: Should target CPA be my current CPA or goal CPA?**
A: Goal CPA (slightly better than current). If current is $80, set target to $70-75.

**Q: Can I use both CPA and ROAS?**
A: Pick one. Use ROAS if you have revenue tracking, CPA if you don't.

**Q: How often should I update profile?**
A: Quarterly review, or immediately when major changes occur.
