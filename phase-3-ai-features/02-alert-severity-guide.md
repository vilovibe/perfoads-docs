## How Severity Is Calculated

### The AI's Assessment Process

**AI considers 4 factors**:

**1. Financial Impact**
```
High impact = High severity
- Wasting $500/day â†’ Severity 9
- Missing $50/day opportunity â†’ Severity 5
- $5/day inefficiency â†’ Severity 2
```

**2. Urgency**
```
Fast-growing problems = Higher severity
- Budget exhausted 3 days in a row â†’ Severity 8
- CTR declining gradually over 30 days â†’ Severity 5
- Static low Quality Score â†’ Severity 3
```

**3. Scope**
```
More affected = Higher severity
- All campaigns stopped â†’ Severity 10
- 1 of 10 campaigns affected â†’ Severity 6
- 3 of 500 keywords underperforming â†’ Severity 2
```

**4. Business Context**
```
Your goals matter
- If target CPA is $50, actual $51 â†’ Severity 4
- If target CPA is $50, actual $80 â†’ Severity 8
- If no target set â†’ Default severity based on trend
```

---

## Severity 10: CRITICAL ðŸ”´

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Campaigns completely stopped or major money being wasted
**Urgency**: Immediate action required
**Timeline**: Fix within 1 hour
**Color**: Bright red

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: All Campaigns Stopped**
```
Severity: 10/10
Category: Technical Issues
Title: All active campaigns are paused

Your Google Ads account shows all 15 campaigns in PAUSED
status. No ads are currently running. This happened at
9:47 AM today.

Possible causes:
- Billing failure
- Policy violation suspension
- Manual pause (accidental?)

Action: Log into Google Ads immediately to diagnose and
restore campaigns.

Impact: $0 spend, $0 revenue until fixed
```

**Example 2: Billing Failure**
```
Severity: 10/10
Category: Technical Issues
Title: Payment method declined - campaigns will pause soon

Google Ads billing failed for payment method ending in 4523.
Campaigns will automatically pause within 24 hours if not
resolved.

Action: Update payment method in Google Ads billing settings
immediately.

Impact: All campaigns at risk of stopping
```

**Example 3: Massive Budget Overspend**
```
Severity: 10/10
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Account spent $4,500 in one day (450% over budget)

Yesterday's spend was $4,500 against a monthly budget of
$3,000. Daily budget limits appear to have failed or were
removed.

Action: Immediately verify budget settings in all campaigns
and pause overspending campaigns if needed.

Impact: Budget exhausted for entire month in one day
```

**When you see severity 10**: Drop everything and fix it now. These issues stop campaigns or waste massive amounts of money.

---

## Severity 9: CRITICAL ðŸ”´

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Significant money being wasted or major performance failure
**Urgency**: Same day action required
**Timeline**: Fix within 4 hours
**Color**: Red

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Disapproved Ads**
```
Severity: 9/10
Category: Technical Issues
Title: 14 of 16 ads disapproved - only 2 ads running

Google disapproved 14 ads across 5 campaigns for
"Unacceptable business practices" policy violation.
Only 2 ads remain active.

Impact: Limited ad rotation severely restricting impression
share. Currently showing for only 12% of eligible searches.

Action: Review disapproved ads, identify policy violation,
create compliant replacement ads today.

Estimated loss: ~$800/day in missed revenue
```

**Example 2: Conversion Tracking Broken**
```
Severity: 9/10
Category: Conversion Tracking
Title: Zero conversions recorded in 5 days despite 1,200 clicks

Your campaigns generated 1,200 clicks in the last 5 days
with $2,400 spend, but zero conversions were recorded.

Historical average: 48 conversions per 1,200 clicks

This suggests conversion tracking is broken, not that
conversions stopped happening.

Action: Verify conversion tracking pixel on website. Check
Google Ads conversion tag status.

Impact: Can't optimize campaigns without conversion data.
Likely wasting ~$1,500 on inefficient keywords.
```

**Example 3: Budget Exhaustion**
```
Severity: 9/10
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Daily budget exhausted by 2 PM for 5 consecutive days

Campaign "Brand Keywords" has spent its full $100 daily
budget before 2 PM EST for 5 days straight.

You're missing 10 hours of daily traffic. Historical data
shows 45% of conversions happen between 6-11 PM.

Action: Increase daily budget to $180 or redistribute spend
from underperforming campaigns.

Estimated missed revenue: $400/day
```

**When you see severity 9**: Clear your schedule for the next few hours and fix this today. High financial impact.

---

## Severity 8: HIGH ðŸŸ 

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Meaningful money being wasted or performance declining
**Urgency**: Same day action preferred
**Timeline**: Fix before end of business day
**Color**: Orange

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: CPC Spike**
```
Severity: 8/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: Average CPC increased 78% in last 7 days

Your average CPC jumped from $4.20 to $7.50 in the past
week with no corresponding improvement in conversion rate
or Quality Score.

Affected campaigns: All search campaigns
Additional cost: ~$350/day vs previous week

Possible causes:
- Increased competition
- Bid strategy change
- Seasonal demand spike

Action: Review bid strategy, check competition, consider
lowering max CPC limits.

Impact: Budget exhausting faster, ROI declining
```

**Example 2: Impression Share Plummet**
```
Severity: 8/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: Search impression share dropped from 68% to 31%

Your impression share on search network fell by more than
half in the past 10 days.

Primary cause: "Lost IS (rank)" increased to 52% (was 18%)

This means competitors are outbidding you or have better
Quality Scores.

Action: Increase bids by 25% on top keywords or improve
Quality Score through better ad relevance.

Impact: Losing ~$600/day in potential revenue
```

**Example 3: Quality Score Degradation**
```
Severity: 8/10
Category: Quality Score Problems
Title: 25 high-volume keywords dropped to QS 3-4

Your top 25 keywords (60% of total clicks) all saw Quality
Score drop from 7-8 to 3-4 in the past 2 weeks.

This is causing CPCs to increase by an average of $3.20 per
click on these keywords.

Root cause: Recent landing page redesign has poor mobile
experience rating.

Action: Fix landing page mobile experience or create new
mobile-specific landing pages.

Impact: Paying 2x more per click than necessary
```

**When you see severity 8**: Prioritize this over routine tasks. Fix today before it gets worse.

---

## Severity 7: HIGH ðŸŸ 

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Performance issues affecting ROI
**Urgency**: Fix within 24 hours
**Timeline**: Today or tomorrow
**Color**: Orange

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Declining CTR**
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: CTR declined 22% over past 14 days

Your click-through rate dropped from 3.8% to 2.96% in the
last two weeks across search campaigns.

This reduces Quality Score and increases CPC over time.

Possible causes:
- Ad copy fatigue (same ads running 6+ months)
- Competitor ads more compelling
- Seasonal shift in search behavior

Action: Refresh ad copy with new headlines and descriptions.
Test different value propositions.

Impact: Lower Quality Score will increase costs by ~15%
```

**Example 2: Uneven Budget Pacing**
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Spending 85% of monthly budget in first 15 days

You've spent $2,550 of your $3,000 monthly budget with 15
days remaining in the month.

Current pace: Will exhaust budget by day 18
Optimal pace: $100/day for full month coverage

Action: Reduce daily budgets by 30% across all campaigns
to extend coverage through month end.

Impact: Campaigns will pause mid-month if not adjusted
```

**Example 3: Geographic Inefficiency**
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Geographic Performance
Title: California has 3x better conversion rate than average

California traffic converts at 8.2% vs 2.7% average across
all other states, yet receives only 20% of budget.

Opportunity: Reallocating 40% more budget to California
could increase overall conversions by ~35%.

Action: Increase location bid adjustments for California
to +60% or create California-specific campaigns.

Impact: Missing $450/week in additional conversions
```

**When you see severity 7**: Schedule time today or first thing tomorrow to address this.

---

## Severity 6: MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Optimization opportunities or moderate inefficiencies
**Urgency**: Fix this week
**Timeline**: 1-3 days
**Color**: Yellow

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Underperforming Ad Groups**
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: 8 ad groups have zero conversions in 30 days

8 of your 45 ad groups generated 1,240 clicks but zero
conversions in the past month, wasting $1,850.

These ad groups have CTR of 2.1% (normal) but 0% conversion
rate (broken).

Possible issues:
- Wrong landing pages
- Poor keyword-to-page match
- Mobile usability problems

Action: Review each ad group's landing page relevance and
user experience. Pause worst performers.

Impact: Eliminating waste could save $450/week
```

**Example 2: Search Term Waste**
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 15 search terms cost $500+ with zero conversions

You're spending on search terms that don't convert:
- "free google ads" - $180 spent, 0 conversions
- "google ads tutorial" - $145 spent, 0 conversions
- "how to google ads" - $95 spent, 0 conversions
... (12 more)

Action: Add these as negative keywords to prevent future
waste.

Impact: Saves ~$500/month going forward
```

**Example 3: Mobile vs Desktop Disparity**
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: Mobile CPA is $35 vs $68 on desktop

Your mobile campaigns convert at half the cost of desktop:
- Mobile: 4.2% conversion rate, $35 CPA
- Desktop: 2.1% conversion rate, $68 CPA

Yet you're allocating budget evenly across devices.

Action: Increase mobile bid adjustment to +40% to capture
more efficient traffic.

Impact: Could improve overall CPA by 18%
```

**When you see severity 6**: Add to this week's task list. Not urgent but worth addressing soon.

---

## Severity 5: MEDIUM ðŸŸ¡

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Moderate optimization gains available
**Urgency**: Fix within a week
**Timeline**: 3-7 days
**Color**: Yellow

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Ad Schedule Opportunity**
```
Severity: 5/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 72% of conversions happen Mon-Fri 9 AM-6 PM

Your conversion data shows strong time-of-day patterns:
- Mon-Fri 9 AM-6 PM: 72% of conversions, 3.8% conv rate
- Evenings/Weekends: 28% of conversions, 1.2% conv rate

Currently running ads 24/7 with no bid adjustments.

Action: Create ad schedule with +30% bid adjustment during
peak hours, -40% during off-peak.

Impact: Could improve ROI by 12-15%
```

**Example 2: Keyword Expansion**
```
Severity: 5/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 5 search terms driving 30% of conversions aren't keywords

These search terms are converting well but aren't added as
keywords yet:
- "best google ads consultant near me" - 45 conversions
- "hire google ads expert" - 38 conversions
- "google ads management service" - 29 conversions

Action: Add these as exact match keywords with dedicated
ad groups for better control and Quality Score.

Impact: Better control over top converters, improved QS
```

**Example 3: Extension Opportunity**
```
Severity: 5/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: No sitelink extensions enabled

Your ads don't have sitelink extensions, which typically
improve CTR by 10-15%.

Competitors in your space all use sitelinks effectively.

Action: Create 4-6 sitelink extensions highlighting key
services/offers.

Impact: Expected CTR lift of 10% = ~80 more clicks/week
```

**When you see severity 5**: Put on this week's optimization list. Good improvements available.

---

## Severity 4: LOW ðŸŸ¡

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Minor inefficiencies or small optimization gains
**Urgency**: Address when convenient
**Timeline**: This month
**Color**: Light yellow

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Low-Volume Keyword Waste**
```
Severity: 4/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 40 keywords each spent $5-10 with zero conversions

You have many low-volume keywords that aren't converting:
- Individual spend: $5-12 each
- Total waste: ~$320 over 30 days
- Click volume: 1-3 clicks each

Action: Pause keywords with <5 clicks and 0 conversions in
30 days. They're too low volume to evaluate properly.

Impact: Small ongoing savings
```

**Example 2: Old Ads**
```
Severity: 4/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 8 ads have been running unchanged for 6+ months

Your ad creative hasn't been refreshed in over 6 months.

While performance is stable, testing new messaging could
uncover wins. Ads go stale over time.

Action: Create 2-3 new ad variations per ad group to test
new angles.

Impact: Potential 5-10% CTR improvement
```

**Example 3: Quality Score 5 Keywords**
```
Severity: 4/10
Category: Quality Score Problems
Title: 30 keywords have Quality Score of 5

These keywords are "average" but could be better:
- QS 5 keywords: 30 total
- Collective clicks: ~800/month
- If improved to QS 7: Save ~$0.80/click

Action: Improve ad relevance and landing page experience
for these keywords.

Impact: Moderate cost savings if optimized
```

**When you see severity 4**: Batch these into monthly optimization sessions. Not urgent.

---

## Severity 3: LOW ðŸŸ¡

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Very minor issues or distant opportunities
**Urgency**: Consider in next optimization round
**Timeline**: Next 1-2 months
**Color**: Light yellow

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Small Geographic Variances**
```
Severity: 3/10
Category: Geographic Performance
Title: Nevada has 15% higher conversion rate than average

Small sample size (only 25 conversions in 30 days) but
Nevada shows promise:
- Nevada: 4.2% conversion rate
- Average: 3.6% conversion rate

Not enough volume to confidently act on yet.

Action: Monitor for another 30-60 days. If pattern holds,
increase Nevada bids.

Impact: Minimal near-term impact
```

**Example 2: Campaign Naming**
```
Severity: 3/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: Campaign names don't follow consistent convention

Your campaigns use mixed naming styles:
- "Brand - Exact"
- "brand_broad"
- "Competitor_Campaign"
- "non_brand_test"

This makes reporting and organization harder.

Action: Standardize campaign naming convention for easier
management.

Impact: Organizational benefit only
```

**Example 3: Unused Features**
```
Severity: 3/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: No callout extensions in use

You could add callout extensions to highlight unique selling
points (free shipping, 24/7 support, etc.).

Minor CTR benefit expected (2-5%).

Action: Add callout extensions when creating next ad batch.

Impact: Small CTR improvement
```

**When you see severity 3**: Note for future reference. Very low priority.

---

## Severity 2: INFO ðŸ”µ

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Tracking information, no action needed
**Urgency**: None
**Timeline**: N/A
**Color**: Blue

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Positive Trend**
```
Severity: 2/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: Conversion rate increased 12% this week

Your conversion rate improved from 3.2% to 3.6% in the past
7 days across all campaigns.

No specific change identified - could be seasonal, or recent
optimizations are working.

Action: None required. Continue monitoring.

Impact: Positive, no action needed
```

**Example 2: Data Observation**
```
Severity: 2/10
Category: Geographic Performance
Title: Wyoming has only 3 clicks in 30 days

Very low traffic from Wyoming. This is expected for small
population states.

Action: None. Just context.

Impact: None
```

**Example 3: Seasonal Note**
```
Severity: 2/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: November has historically highest conversion rate

Looking at historical data, November averages 15% higher
conversion rate than other months (likely holiday shopping).

Action: Plan to increase budgets in November if pattern
continues.

Impact: Future planning information
```

**When you see severity 2**: Read for context. No action required.

---

## Severity 1: INFO ðŸ”µ

### Characteristics

**Impact**: Context only
**Urgency**: None
**Timeline**: N/A
**Color**: Light blue

---

### Real Examples

**Example 1: Account Milestone**
```
Severity: 1/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: Account generated 1,000th conversion this month

Congratulations! Your account just passed 1,000 total
conversions this month.

Historical average: ~850/month

Action: None - just a milestone notification

Impact: Positive context
```

**Example 2: Sync Completed**
```
Severity: 1/10
Category: Technical Issues

Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: Your account structure follows best practices

Your campaigns are well-organized with clear naming, proper
ad group themes, and good keyword grouping.

Action: Continue current organization approach

Impact: Positive reinforcement
```

**When you see severity 1**: Nice to know. No action needed.

---

## How Business Context Affects Severity

### Target CPA Impact

**Scenario 1: Conservative Target**
```
Your target CPA: $30
Actual CPA: $35

Alert severity: 7/10 (high)
Reason: 17% over target is significant deviation
```

**Scenario 2: Flexible Target**
```
Your target CPA: $100
Actual CPA: $105

Alert severity: 4/10 (low)
Reason: 5% over target is within acceptable range
```

**Lesson**: Same $5 difference, different severity based on your goals

---

### Budget Size Impact

**Scenario 1: Small Budget**
```
Monthly budget: $500
Daily waste: $15

Alert severity: 8/10 (high)
Reason: $15/day waste = 90% of daily budget
```

**Scenario 2: Large Budget**
```
Monthly budget: $50,000
Daily waste: $15

Alert severity: 3/10 (low)
Reason: $15/day waste = 0.9% of daily budget
```

**Lesson**: Same $15 waste, different severity based on budget scale

---

### Account Maturity Impact

**Scenario 1: New Account (<30 days)**
```
Issue: Low Quality Score on keywords

Alert severity: 5/10 (medium)
Reason: Expected for new accounts, not urgent
```

**Scenario 2: Mature Account (1+ year)**
```
Issue: Low Quality Score on keywords

Alert severity: 7/10 (high)
Reason: Unusual degradation for established account
```

**Lesson**: Same issue, different context changes severity

---

## Interpreting Severity for Your Situation

### Factor 1: Account Size

**Small accounts ($500-$2,000/month)**:
- Severity 6+ = Act quickly
- Severity 4-5 = Monitor
- Severity 1-3 = Ignore unless repeating

**Medium accounts ($2,000-$10,000/month)**:
- Severity 7+ = Act quickly
- Severity 5-6 = Act this week
- Severity 3-4 = Monthly optimization
- Severity 1-2 = Track

**Large accounts ($10,000+/month)**:
- Severity 8+ = Drop everything
- Severity 6-7 = Same day
- Severity 4-5 = This week
- Severity 1-3 = Batch monthly

---

### Factor 2: Agency vs In-House

**Agency (managing 20+ clients)**:
- Focus on severity 7+ only
- Batch severity 5-6 by client
- Ignore severity 1-4 unless recurring

**In-House (1-5 accounts)**:
- Act on severity 5+ promptly
- Review severity 3-4 monthly
- Use severity 1-2 for reporting

---

### Factor 3: Client Expectations

**High-touch clients**:
- Address severity 6+ within 24 hours
- Report on all severity 4+ weekly
- Use lower severity for context

**Hands-off clients**:
- Fix severity 7+ immediately
- Batch severity 5-6 for monthly reports
- Don't report severity 1-4

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Don't Ignore Low Severity

**Why they matter**:
- Severity 4 today = Severity 7 next week
- Small inefficiencies compound
- Good learning opportunities

**Strategy**:
- Batch fix severity 3-4 monthly
- Track recurring low-severity alerts
- Address patterns even if individually low

---

### Severity Changes Over Time

**Escalation**:
```
Week 1: Severity 5 (Medium)
Week 2: Severity 7 (High) - issue worsening
Week 3: Severity 9 (Critical) - now urgent
```

**Recommendation**: Fix severity 5-6 alerts before they escalate

---

### Context Is Key

**Same alert, different severity**:
- "CPC increased $1" = Severity 8 if CPC was $2 (50% increase)
- "CPC increased $1" = Severity 4 if CPC was $20 (5% increase)

**Always read the full alert** - severity number alone isn't enough

---

### Use Severity to Delegate

**If managing a team**:
- Junior: Fix severity 3-6
- Mid-level: Fix severity 5-8
- Senior: Fix severity 8-10 + strategy

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I change alert severity manually?**
A: Not currently. Severity is AI-calculated. Future versions may allow manual overrides.

**Q: Why does AI sometimes rate similar issues differently?**
A: Context matters. Same issue in different campaign sizes, budgets, or goals gets different severity.

**Q: What if I think severity is wrong?**
A: Decline the alert with feedback. AI learns from this and adjusts future ratings.

**Q: Is severity 10 always critical?**
A: Yes. Severity 10 means campaigns stopped or massive waste. Always investigate immediately.

**Q: Should I fix all severity 7+ alerts same day?**
A: Ideally yes, but prioritize based on your capacity and account size. Large agencies may batch by client.

**Q: Do alerts auto-escalate in severity if ignored?**
A: Yes, if the underlying issue worsens. A severity 5 alert today can become severity 8 tomorrow if the problem grows.
