## What Are Smart Alerts?

**Definition**: Automated notifications generated by AI when it detects performance issues, budget problems, technical errors, or optimization opportunities in your Google Ads campaigns.

**Example**:
```
Severity: 8/10 - High Priority
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Daily budget exhausted before 2 PM

Your campaign "Summer Sale 2025" spent its entire $100 daily
budget by 1:45 PM EST for the past 3 days. You're missing
evening traffic (40% of your conversions happen after 6 PM).

Recommended Action: Increase daily budget to $150 or adjust
ad schedule to focus spend on 6-11 PM when conversion rate
is highest (5.2% vs 2.1% daytime average).
```

## Understanding Alert Severity

### The 1-10 Scale

**How AI assigns severity**:
- Impact on performance (revenue, conversions, cost)
- Urgency (how fast problem is growing)
- Scope (how many campaigns/keywords affected)
- Historical context (is this new or ongoing?)

**Severity Levels**:

**9-10: Critical** (Red) 🔴
- Immediate action required
- Significant money being wasted
- Campaigns stopped/disapproved
- Major performance degradation
- Example: "All ads disapproved - campaign not running"

**7-8: High** (Orange) 🟠
- Address today
- Performance issues affecting ROI
- Budget mismanagement
- Conversion tracking problems
- Example: "Budget exhausted by 2 PM daily"

**5-6: Medium** (Yellow) 🟡
- Fix this week
- Optimization opportunities
- Gradual performance decline
- Quality score problems
- Example: "CTR dropped 15% over last 7 days"

**3-4: Low** (Light Yellow) 🟡
- Consider when time permits
- Minor inefficiencies
- Small optimization gains
- Future planning
- Example: "5 keywords have Quality Score of 4"

**1-2: Informational** (Blue) 🔵
- No action needed
- FYI notifications
- Positive trends
- Context updates
- Example: "Conversion rate up 8% this week"

## Alert Categories Explained

### Budget Issues 💰

**What it catches**:
- Daily budget exhausted early
- Budget overspend or underspend
- Uneven budget pacing
- Budget limiting impression share

**Example**:
> "Campaign spending only $20 of $100 daily budget. Increasing bids by 30% could capture more traffic without exceeding budget."

**Why it matters**: Budget problems waste money or miss opportunities

---

### Performance Problems 📉

**What it catches**:
- CTR declining
- Conversion rate dropping
- CPC increasing
- Impression share falling
- ROAS degrading

**Example**:
> "Average CPC increased from $3.50 to $5.20 (49% jump) in last 14 days with no improvement in conversion rate."

**Why it matters**: Performance declines directly impact ROI

---

### Technical Issues ⚠️

**What it catches**:
- Ads disapproved
- Tracking problems
- Conversion tracking errors
- Extension issues
- Landing page problems

**Example**:
> "3 ads disapproved for policy violation. Campaign has only 1 active ad remaining, limiting impression share."

**Why it matters**: Technical issues can stop campaigns entirely

---

### Strategy Recommendations 🎯

**What it catches**:
- Bid strategy optimization
- Ad schedule adjustments
- Geographic targeting refinement
- Keyword opportunities

**Example**:
> "85% of conversions happen Mon-Fri 9 AM-5 PM. Consider ad scheduling to increase bids during these hours."

**Why it matters**: Strategic changes improve efficiency

---

### Quality Score Problems ⭐

**What it catches**:
- Low Quality Score keywords
- Expected CTR issues
- Ad relevance problems
- Landing page experience warnings

**Example**:
> "12 keywords have Quality Score of 3 or lower, causing 2x higher CPCs. Improving ad relevance could save $800/month."

**Why it matters**: Quality Score directly affects CPC and ad position

---

### Conversion Tracking 🎯

**What it catches**:
- Missing conversion events
- Conversion tracking errors
- Attribution problems
- Unusual conversion patterns

**Example**:
> "No conversions recorded in last 7 days despite 450 clicks. Check if conversion tracking pixel is installed correctly."

**Why it matters**: Can't optimize what you can't measure

---

### Geographic Performance 🌍

**What it catches**:
- High-performing locations
- Underperforming regions
- Location bid adjustments needed
- Geographic expansion opportunities

**Example**:
> "California generates 65% of conversions at 40% lower CPA than other states. Consider increasing California budget."

**Why it matters**: Location targeting impacts efficiency

---

### Bidding Strategy 💡

**What it catches**:
- Suboptimal bid strategy
- Manual bidding inefficiencies
- Automated bidding recommendations
- Bid adjustment opportunities

**Example**:
> "Manual CPC campaign has high conversion volume. Switching to Target CPA could automate bid optimization and reduce workload."

**Why it matters**: Right bidding strategy improves results and saves time

## Why Smart Alerts Beat Manual Monitoring

### The Manual Way (Without Alerts)

**Your workflow**:
1. Log into Google Ads
2. Open each campaign
3. Check metrics manually
4. Look for anomalies
5. Compare to previous periods
6. Spot patterns (maybe)
7. Decide what to fix
8. Repeat for 20 campaigns

**Time required**: 30-45 minutes per client
**Frequency**: Weekly if you're diligent
**Issues caught**: Only obvious problems

**Problems**:
- Easy to miss subtle declines
- No historical context
- Hard to compare across campaigns
- Time-consuming for multiple clients
- Reactive (you find problems after money is wasted)

---

### The Smart Alerts Way

**What happens**:
1. AI analyzes all campaigns automatically
2. Spots patterns humans miss
3. Compares to 30-day baseline
4. Identifies issues before they escalate
5. Provides specific recommendations
6. Prioritizes by severity
7. Updates daily

**Time required**: 2 minutes to review alerts
**Frequency**: Daily, automatically
**Issues caught**: Everything significant

**Benefits**:
- Proactive problem detection
- Consistent analysis across all clients
- Historical context included
- Specific action recommendations
- Saves 95% of monitoring time

## AI Learning from Your Feedback

### How Feedback Improves Alerts

**When you accept an alert**:
- AI learns this type of issue matters to you
- Similar issues get higher severity in future
- More alerts of this category generated

**When you decline an alert**:
- AI learns this wasn't valuable
- Future similar alerts get lower severity
- AI adjusts recommendation style

**Long-term benefits**:
- Alerts become more personalized
- Severity ratings more accurate
- Recommendations match your preferences
- Less noise, more signal

---

### Privacy of Feedback

**Important**:
- Your accept/decline actions stay in your account
- Not shared with other users
- Only affects your AI's behavior
- Full control over alert preferences

---

## Tips & Best Practices

### Daily Alert Review

**Morning routine**:
1. Check global alerts view (2 minutes)
2. Sort by severity (critical first)
3. Open client details for critical alerts
4. Take action on high-priority items
5. Schedule medium-priority for later

**Time investment**: 5-10 minutes
**Result**: Catch problems within 24 hours

---

### Use Severity as a Guide

**Don't ignore low-severity alerts** - they're future problems
**Do prioritize high-severity** - these cost money now

**Strategy**:
- Critical (9-10): Fix immediately
- High (7-8): Fix today
- Medium (5-6): Fix this week
- Low (3-4): Monthly optimization session
- Info (1-2): Read for context

---

### Accept vs Decline Thoughtfully

**Don't blindly accept all alerts** - AI needs honest feedback

**Good reasons to accept**:
- Recommendation makes sense
- You plan to implement it
- Issue is real and important

**Good reasons to decline**:
- Recommendation doesn't fit strategy
- Alert is inaccurate
- Priority is too high/low
- Not relevant to business goals

**Your feedback teaches the AI** what matters to you

---

### Combine with Other Data

**Alerts + Performance Charts**:
- Alert says "CTR declining"
- Chart shows exactly when decline started
- Correlate to campaign changes

**Alerts + Sync Logs**:
- Alert about disapproved ads
- Sync log shows when they were disapproved
- Identify root cause timing

**Alerts + AI Chat**:
- Get alert about budget issue
- Ask AI Chat for detailed breakdown
- Get specific campaign-by-campaign analysis

---

### Force Analysis Strategically

**Don't overuse** (costs tokens, doesn't add value if data is fresh)

**Good times to force**:
- After major campaign restructure
- Before client presentations
- When troubleshooting urgent issue
- Testing new optimization approach

**Bad times to force**:
- Every hour (waste of tokens)
- Data already fresh (< 6 hours old)
- No changes made since last analysis

---

## Common Questions

**Q: How often are alerts generated?**
A: Automatically after each daily sync. You can also force analysis manually anytime.

**Q: Do alerts replace manual Google Ads checking?**
A: They catch 95% of issues automatically, but you should still review Google Ads directly for strategy changes and new campaign setup.

**Q: What if I disagree with an alert's severity?**
A: Decline it and provide feedback. The AI learns from this and will adjust future severity ratings.

**Q: Can I disable alerts for a specific client?**
A: Not currently, but you can filter them out. Alert customization is planned for future release.

**Q: How many alerts are too many?**
A: Healthy accounts have 3-7 medium/low alerts. 10+ high-severity alerts suggests major campaign issues need attention.

**Q: Do alerts consider my business goals?**
A: Yes, if you've filled out the business profile. AI uses your target CPA, ROAS goals, and budget to assess severity.

**Q: What happens to old alerts?**
A: They move to Alert History after 7 days or when issue is resolved. History is kept for 90 days.

**Q: Can I export alerts?**
A: Not currently. Export functionality is planned for future release.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: No alerts appearing

**Diagnostics**:
1. Check if client has been synced recently
2. Verify sync completed successfully
3. Check if Force Analysis is available

**Common causes**:
- Client never synced (no data to analyze)
- Sync failed (AI can't analyze incomplete data)
- Very new account (not enough historical data)

**Solution**:
- Run Smart Sync first
- Wait for sync to complete
- Force Full Analysis after sync succeeds

---

### Problem: Too many low-priority alerts

**Diagnostics**:
1. Check client campaign health in Google Ads
2. Review Quality Scores
3. Check for disapproved ads

**Cause**: Campaign has many small issues

**Solution**:
- Address high-priority alerts first
- Decline irrelevant low-priority alerts
- Batch-fix low-priority items monthly
- AI will learn to reduce noise

---

### Problem: Alert says issue is fixed but still showing

**Cause**: Alert hasn't been resolved yet

**Solution**:
1. Accept the alert to mark it resolved
2. Or wait for next automatic analysis
3. Or force full analysis now

Alerts don't auto-dismiss - you must accept/decline to clear them
