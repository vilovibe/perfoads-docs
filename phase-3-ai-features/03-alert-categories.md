## 1. Budget Issues üí∞

### What This Category Detects

**All budget-related problems**:
- Daily budget exhausted too early
- Monthly budget pacing issues
- Overspending budgets
- Underspending budgets (wasted opportunity)
- Budget-limited impression share
- Uneven spending patterns

**Why it matters**: Budget issues either waste money or leave money on the table

---

### Common Budget Issue Alerts

#### Example 1: Early Budget Exhaustion
```
Severity: 8/10
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Campaign budget depleted by 3 PM daily

Your "Brand Campaign" spends its full $80 daily budget by
2:45 PM EST on average over the last 5 days.

Traffic analysis shows:
- 6 AM-3 PM: 1,250 impressions, $80 spent
- 3 PM-midnight: 0 impressions, $0 spent (budget exhausted)

Historical data: 38% of your conversions happen 6-11 PM

Recommended Action: Increase daily budget to $135 to cover
evening traffic, or reduce bids by 25% to extend budget.

Impact: Missing ~$320/week in evening conversions
```

**Fix**:
1. Increase budget if ROI is good
2. OR reduce bids to make budget last longer
3. OR use ad scheduling to concentrate spend on best hours

---

#### Example 2: Budget Underspend
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Spending only 45% of allocated monthly budget

Your $5,000 monthly budget shows only $2,250 spent with
12 days remaining (expect to spend ~$3,200 total).

Cause: Daily budgets set too low at $80/day. Should be
~$165/day to spend full monthly allocation.

Recommended Action: Increase daily budgets across campaigns
to utilize full monthly budget.

Impact: Missing ~$1,800 in monthly ad spend that could
generate estimated 45 additional conversions
```

**Fix**:
1. Increase daily budgets proportionally
2. Expand keyword targeting to capture more traffic
3. Increase bids to be more competitive

---

#### Example 3: Impression Share Lost to Budget
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Budget Issues
Title: Losing 42% impression share due to budget limits

Your campaigns show "Search IS Lost (budget)" at 42%,
meaning you could get 42% more impressions with higher
budget.

Current: Showing for 58% of eligible searches
Potential: Could show for 100% of searches

Estimated missed opportunity: ~180 conversions/month

Recommended Action: Increase budgets by 70% to capture
full impression share, or prioritize best-performing
campaigns.

Impact: Budget limiting reach and revenue
```

**Fix**:
1. Increase budgets on high-ROI campaigns
2. Pause low-performing campaigns to free up budget
3. Shift budget from Display to Search if Search is limited

---

### Budget Issues Best Practices

**Daily monitoring**:
- Check budget pacing each morning
- Adjust if spending too fast or slow
- Monitor impression share lost to budget

**Monthly planning**:
- Set daily budgets at 110% of target (allows for variance)
- Review mid-month pacing
- Adjust for seasonality

**Budget allocation**:
- Prioritize proven performers
- Don't spread budget too thin
- Minimum $20/day per campaign

---

## 2. Performance Problems üìâ

### What This Category Detects

**All performance degradation**:
- CTR declining
- CPC increasing
- Conversion rate dropping
- ROAS falling
- Impression share decreasing
- Engagement metrics declining

**Why it matters**: Performance problems directly reduce ROI

---

### Common Performance Problem Alerts

#### Example 1: Declining CTR
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: CTR dropped 28% in past 2 weeks

Your average click-through rate fell from 4.2% to 3.0%
across all search campaigns.

This reduces Quality Score, which increases CPCs, creating
a negative spiral.

Possible causes:
- Ad fatigue (same ads running 8+ months)
- New competitors with better ads
- Seasonal shift in user behavior

Recommended Action: Refresh ad copy. Create 3 new ad
variations per ad group with updated messaging.

Impact: Lower CTR = higher CPCs = 15-20% cost increase
```

**Fix**:
1. Write new ad copy with fresh angles
2. Test different headlines and descriptions
3. Update calls-to-action
4. Add emotional hooks or urgency

---

#### Example 2: CPC Spike
```
Severity: 8/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: Average CPC increased 63% without performance gain

Your CPC jumped from $3.80 to $6.20 over 10 days with no
corresponding improvement in conversion rate.

Affected: All campaigns
Additional cost: ~$420/week vs previous average

Likely causes:
- Increased competition (new competitor launched)
- Quality Score decline
- Bid strategy became more aggressive

Recommended Action: Review Search Term report for new
competition. Consider lowering max CPC limits or pausing
if ROI is negative.

Impact: Budget exhausting faster, lower ROI
```

**Fix**:
1. Check competitor activity in Auction Insights
2. Review and improve Quality Score
3. Lower max CPC caps if ROI is suffering
4. Switch to Target CPA if using manual bidding

---

#### Example 3: Conversion Rate Decline
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Performance Problems
Title: Conversion rate fell from 5.2% to 3.1% in 14 days

Your conversion rate dropped 40% in two weeks despite
stable traffic quality (CTR unchanged).

This suggests landing page or offer problem, not traffic
quality issue.

Recent changes detected:
- Landing page redesign deployed 16 days ago
- New checkout flow implemented

Recommended Action: A/B test current vs previous landing
page. Review analytics for drop-off points in new checkout
flow.

Impact: 40% fewer conversions from same traffic = major
revenue loss
```

**Fix**:
1. Rollback recent landing page changes
2. Check page load speed (slow = fewer conversions)
3. Test different offers/CTAs
4. Review mobile experience specifically

---

### Performance Problems Best Practices

**Weekly reviews**:
- Compare week-over-week metrics
- Catch declining trends early
- Act before 20% change threshold

**Root cause analysis**:
- Don't just fix symptoms
- Find underlying cause
- Track correlation to changes you made

**Benchmark comparison**:
- Compare to your historical average
- Compare to industry benchmarks
- Track seasonality patterns

---

## 3. Technical Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### What This Category Detects

**All technical failures**:
- Ads disapproved
- Tracking pixel errors
- Conversion tag problems
- Extension errors
- Landing page technical issues
- Feed errors (Shopping)
- Account suspension warnings

**Why it matters**: Technical issues can completely stop campaigns

---

### Common Technical Issue Alerts

#### Example 1: Ad Disapprovals
```
Severity: 9/10
Category: Technical Issues
Title: 9 of 12 ads disapproved for policy violation

Google disapproved 9 ads across your account for
"Misleading content" policy violation.

Affected campaigns: Brand, Competitor, Non-Brand
Active ads remaining: 3 (severely limits ad rotation)

Disapproval reason: Claims like "Best in Industry" and
"#1 Rated" require substantiation with third-party proof.

Recommended Action:
1. Remove unsupported claims from ad copy
2. Add disclaimers or third-party ratings
3. Create replacement ads with compliant messaging

Impact: Limited ad pool restricts impression share to ~15%
```

**Fix**:
1. Review Google Ads policy center for specific violation
2. Edit ads to be compliant (remove claims, add proof)
3. Request re-review in Google Ads
4. Create new compliant ads as backup

---

#### Example 2: Conversion Tracking Broken
```
Severity: 9/10
Category: Technical Issues
Title: Zero conversions recorded in 6 days

Your campaigns show 0 conversions in the past 6 days
despite 1,850 clicks and normal traffic patterns.

Historical baseline: ~95 conversions per 1,850 clicks

This strongly suggests conversion tracking is broken,
not that conversions actually stopped.

Diagnostic steps:
1. Check if Google Ads conversion tag is on site
2. Verify tag is firing (use Google Tag Assistant)
3. Check for recent website changes that removed tag

Recommended Action: Contact developer to verify conversion
tracking implementation immediately.

Impact: Can't optimize without conversion data. Likely
wasting spend on non-converting keywords.
```

**Fix**:
1. Use Google Tag Assistant to check tag status
2. Verify tag placement on thank-you/confirmation page
3. Test conversion with live purchase/form fill
4. Check if recent site update broke tag

---

#### Example 3: Landing Page Issues
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Technical Issues
Title: Landing page returns 404 error for top ad group

Your highest-volume ad group "Best Seller Products" is
sending traffic to a landing page that returns 404 error.

Affected:
- 850 clicks in past 3 days = $1,700 wasted
- 0 conversions (impossible to convert on 404 page)

Cause: Product page moved or deleted without updating ads

Recommended Action: Update all ads in this ad group with
correct landing page URL immediately.

Impact: 100% waste on this ad group traffic
```

**Fix**:
1. Verify correct landing page URL
2. Update all ads with fixed URL
3. Check other ad groups for similar issues
4. Set up monitoring for 404 errors

---

### Technical Issues Best Practices

**Daily checks**:
- Review ad approval status
- Monitor conversion tracking daily
- Check for sudden conversion drops

**Preventive measures**:
- Test landing pages before launching
- Keep backup of ad copy before policy checks
- Monitor Google Ads policy updates

**Quick response**:
- Fix technical issues within hours
- Technical problems escalate quickly
- Every hour = more wasted spend

---

- Audience targeting suggestions

**Why it matters**: Strategic improvements unlock efficiency gains

---

### Common Strategy Recommendation Alerts

#### Example 1: Ad Schedule Opportunity
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 78% of conversions occur Mon-Fri 9 AM-6 PM

Analysis of 450 conversions over 30 days shows clear
time-of-day patterns:

High-performing hours (9 AM-6 PM Mon-Fri):
- 78% of conversions
- 6.2% conversion rate
- $38 CPA

Low-performing hours (evenings/weekends):
- 22% of conversions
- 1.8% conversion rate
- $94 CPA

Currently running ads 24/7 with no bid adjustments.

Recommended Action: Implement ad schedule with +40% bid
adjustment 9 AM-6 PM Mon-Fri, -50% other times.

Impact: Estimated 18% CPA improvement by concentrating
spend on best hours
```

**Fix**:
1. Create ad schedule in campaign settings
2. Increase bids during peak hours
3. Decrease bids during off-hours
4. Monitor for 2 weeks and adjust

---

#### Example 2: Negative Keyword Opportunity
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 18 search terms cost $1,200+ with zero conversions

You're spending on non-converting search terms:
- "free google ads templates" - $285, 0 conv
- "google ads tutorial youtube" - $195, 0 conv
- "how to set up google ads" - $165, 0 conv
... (15 more similar terms)

These are informational queries, not buyer intent.

Recommended Action: Add these 18 terms as exact match
negative keywords to prevent future waste.

Impact: Saves ~$1,200/month going forward
```

**Fix**:
1. Export Search Terms report
2. Identify zero-conversion terms with >$50 spend
3. Add as negative keywords at campaign level
4. Review monthly for new waste

---

#### Example 3: Keyword Expansion
```
Severity: 5/10
Category: Strategy Recommendations
Title: 8 high-performing search terms not added as keywords

These search terms are converting well but aren't in your
keyword list yet:

- "google ads consultant near me" - 32 conv, $28 CPA
- "hire google ads expert" - 28 conv, $31 CPA
- "google ads management pricing" - 19 conv, $35 CPA

Adding these as exact match keywords gives you better
control, improves Quality Score, and lowers CPCs.

Recommended Action: Create dedicated ad groups for these
high-converters with exact match keywords.

Impact: Better control over top traffic sources, likely
15-20% CPA improvement on these terms
```

**Fix**:
1. Create new ad groups for each theme
2. Add as exact match keywords
3. Write highly relevant ads
4. Use specific landing pages

---

### Strategy Recommendations Best Practices

**Monthly optimization**:
- Review strategy alerts monthly
- Test top 3 recommendations
- Track impact of changes

**Prioritization**:
- Focus on recommendations with >10% impact
- Test one change at a time
- Measure results before next change

**Long-term planning**:
- Strategy alerts = roadmap
- Queue low-priority recommendations
- Revisit quarterly

---

## 5. Quality Score Problems ‚≠ê

### What This Category Detects

**All Quality Score issues**:
- Low Quality Score keywords (1-4)
- Expected CTR problems
- Ad relevance issues
- Landing page experience warnings
- Quality Score degradation trends

**Why it matters**: Low QS = 2-3x higher CPCs

---

### Common Quality Score Problem Alerts

#### Example 1: Low Quality Score Keywords
```
Severity: 7/10
Category: Quality Score Problems
Title: 15 high-volume keywords have Quality Score 3-4

Your top keywords by traffic volume have poor Quality
Scores:

Keywords with QS 3-4:
- "google ads service" (QS 3) - 850 clicks/mo, $8.50 CPC
- "ppc management" (QS 4) - 720 clicks/mo, $7.20 CPC
... (13 more)

Average CPC impact: Paying 2.2x more than QS 7-8 keywords

If these were QS 7+: Average CPC would be ~$3.80
Current: Average CPC is $8.20

Recommended Action: Improve ad relevance by creating
dedicated ad groups with highly relevant ads for each
keyword theme.

Impact: Potential savings of $2,900/month with QS improvement
```

**Fix**:
1. Create single-keyword ad groups (SKAGs)
2. Write ads with keyword in headline
3. Improve landing page relevance
4. Match landing page headline to ad

---

#### Example 2: Landing Page Experience
```
Severity: 6/10
Category: Quality Score Problems
Title: 22 keywords flagged for "Below average" landing page experience

Google rates your landing page experience as "Below average"
for 22 keywords, citing:

Issues detected:
- Mobile load time >4 seconds
- Pop-ups on mobile
- Thin content
- Navigation unclear

This drags down Quality Score to 4-5 on affected keywords.

Recommended Action:
1. Improve mobile page speed (compress images, minimize CSS)
2. Remove mobile pop-ups
3. Add more content to landing page
4. Simplify navigation

Impact: Landing page experience is 1/3 of QS calculation
```

**Fix**:
1. Run Google PageSpeed Insights
2. Fix technical issues (speed, mobile usability)
3. Add content to meet user intent
4. Remove aggressive pop-ups
5. Test on mobile device

---

### Quality Score Problems Best Practices

**QS monitoring**:
- Check Quality Score weekly
- Track changes over time
- Act when QS drops below 5

**Improvement focus**:
- Expected CTR (30% of QS): Improve ad copy
- Ad Relevance (30% of QS): Match ad to keyword
- Landing Page (30% of QS): Fix page experience

**Measurement**:
- QS improvements take 2-4 weeks to reflect
- Track CPC changes as QS improves
- Document what fixes worked

---

## 6. Conversion Tracking üéØ

### What This Category Detects

**All conversion tracking issues**:
- Zero conversions recorded
- Conversion tracking errors
- Unusual conversion patterns
- Attribution problems
- Conversion value discrepancies

**Why it matters**: Can't optimize what you can't measure

---

### Common Conversion Tracking Alerts

#### Example 1: Conversion Tracking Broken
```
Severity: 9/10
Category: Conversion Tracking
Title: No conversions in 5 days despite normal traffic

5 days of zero conversions with 1,450 clicks suggests
tracking failure, not actual lack of conversions.

Traffic quality unchanged:
- CTR: 3.8% (normal)
- Bounce rate: Normal per analytics
- Time on site: Normal

Historical baseline: ~72 conversions per 1,450 clicks

Diagnostic: Conversion tag likely missing or broken

Recommended Action: Verify Google Ads conversion tag is
installed and firing correctly. Use Google Tag Assistant
to test.

Impact: Flying blind without conversion data
```

**Fix**: (Same as Technical Issues example above)

---

### Conversion Tracking Best Practices

**Daily verification**:
- Check conversion count daily
- Sudden zero = investigate immediately
- Compare to website analytics

**Multiple attribution**:
- Set up multiple conversion actions
- Track micro-conversions (form views, etc.)

Opportunity: Could allocate 35% to Texas

Recommended Action: Increase Texas location bid adjustment
to +60% or create Texas-specific campaigns.

Impact: Shifting budget to Texas could reduce overall CPA
by 22%
```

**Fix**:
1. Set location bid adjustment for Texas: +60%
2. Monitor for 2 weeks
3. Consider creating Texas-specific campaigns
4. Research why Texas performs better

---

### Geographic Performance Best Practices

**Monthly geo review**:
